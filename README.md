#About This Project

##This project was created using JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap, Css, Yarn.
The challenge for this project was to develop skills in the use of arrays, carousel, Slick Carousel, Card and among other necessary resources offered by the framework with some adjustments by css.
The main goal was achieved, which was to learn how to use arrays and other components, as well as adjust their placement.

In fact, I managed to consolidate more knowledge in Arrays, React, bootstrap, slick-carousel, yarn, git, github. I managed to catalog some improvement points and among them is the improvement in the use of arrays.
